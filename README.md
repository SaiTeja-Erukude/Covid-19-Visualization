==================

1. Covid.py         :   It is the python script that generates the map and saves the output in html format.
2. Covid.html       :   It is the ouput generated by the python script. Open this file in a browser to see the covid data visualization.
3. covid_world.json :   The json file that has the geographical structure of world and the world wide covid data.
4. covid_india.json :   This file has the geographical structure of india and the india wide covid data.

A Python library 'folium' is used to generate the world map. 

When hovered on the map, it displays the country/state name, number of confirmed, active, recovered cases and deaths. 

Using the layer control drop down button on the top right corner of the map, one can switch between the world wide, India wide data and different styles of map.
